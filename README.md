## About

(From my LinkedIn profile.)

Engineering professional with proven expertise in Artificial Intelligence, DevOps automation, and Cloud Infrastructure. I have nearly 20 years of experience in engineering and infrastructure management, spanning both physical (on-premises) and, over the past decade, cloud-based environments for multiple companies and clients.

My strengths include CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and information security framework compliance for high-trust environments. I’m methodical, solutions-oriented, and focused on delivering reliable, efficient, and secure systems across AWS, Azure, GCP, and hybrid infrastructures.

Currently, I’m expanding my skills in business, sales, and marketing to better align engineering strategy with go-to-market impact. I also have a strong interest in home automation—combining technical depth with user-friendly design—and I’m an active amateur radio (hamradio) operator.
